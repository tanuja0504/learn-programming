Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.
There are following patterns which can be followed :

Pattern : 0/1 Knapsack Problem
1. Equal Subset Sum
2. Subset Sum
3. Min subset sum difference
4. Count of subset sum
5. Target sum

Pattern : Unbounded Knapsack
